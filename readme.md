# Lightning JS Benchmark suite

Allows the user to test various configurations with the Lightning JS project.
Similar to https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark the Lightning JS benchmark will execute a series of operations to measure the throughput of the framework.

For the official results please see https://lightning-js.github.io/benchmark/

## Operations

The following operations will be executed:
- Create 1,000 rows (5 warmup runs)
- Update all 1,000 rows (5 warmup runs)
- Partial update, update every 10th row for 1,000 rows (3 warmup runs)
- Select row, change color of a selected row (5 warmup runs)
- Swap row, swap 2 rows for a table with 1,000 rows (5 warmup runs)
- Remove row, remove 1 row (5 warm up runs)
- Create many rows, create 10,000 rows (5 warmup runs)
- Append rows to large table, appending 1,000 rows to a table of 1,000 rows (5 warmup runs)

## Why not use js-framework-benchmark

Two reasons:
1) LightningJS is a WebGL framework, `js-framework-benchmark` tests for DOM elements
2) We want to run this on a TV

## Baseline

The baseline is the direct renderer API against which we will compare Application Development frameworks

# Instructions

## Install this

Clone the repository:

`git clone <repo>`

Setup the framework:

`npm run setup`

This should install the dependencies, build the frameworks and copy the frameworks to the dist folder.

If this is the first time that you are using PlayWright (https://playwright.dev/) please make sure you install the PlayWright dependencies by running:

`npm run setup:playwright`


You can also run individual commands by doing:

`npm run build:<x>`

To build a framework or if you want to copy the files:

`npm run copy:<x>`
